# Clinical Practice Guidelines for NSCLC

## Staging: Stage IIIA NSCLC
- Patients with resectable Stage IIIA NSCLC should be considered for multidisciplinary evaluation.

## Treatment Modalities
- **Chemotherapy:** Neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended. Platinum-based doublet chemotherapy is the standard of care.
- **Targeted Therapy:** For patients with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements, targeted therapy should be considered. For PD-L1 > 50%, immunotherapy is a primary option.
- **Surgery:** Lobectomy is the preferred surgical approach for eligible candidates.
- **Radiation:** Post-operative radiation therapy (PORT) may be considered for patients with N2 involvement.

## Recommended Treatment Plan for Stage IIIA NSCLC (PD-L1 > 50%, resectable)
- **Primary Recommendation:** Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with immunotherapy (e.g., platinum-based chemo + pembrolizumab) followed by surgical resection.
- **Alternative:** Concurrent chemoradiation for patients who are not surgical candidates.
